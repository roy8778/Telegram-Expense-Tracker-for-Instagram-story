Get a telegram api token and put it in the a file named: "Token.env"

Make a Telegram chat with your bot.


Send messages in the form: <Word> <amount> <Description> 

the "word" can be:
voeding = food
vervoer = transportation
Vermaak = entertainment
Verblijf = accomodation
overig = Everything else

every time you send a message in this form it will store the value with the word you send.
if you want to see the current values that are attached to the "word" you can send a message "Tussenstand"

if you want to reset the values of a "word"
you can send a message "Reset <word>"

At the end of the day you can send the word "daily" it will reply with a picture (instagram sotry size) with the values on it.
the only thing you have to add is the current date to post it on instagram.

on Github i only uploaded the png for "Daily"
i made another python script that will use any picture you send and convert it to instagram story size and add a overlay to make a nice overview of your expenses.
